The code reposotory for The Working Group on Nephrops Surveys (WGNEPS) is the international coordination group for Nephrops UWTV and trawl surveys within ICES.

For underwater television surveys (UWTV) this group builds on the work of WKNEPHTV 2007, WKNEPHBID 2010, SGNEPS 2009, 2010 & 2012 and WKNEPH 2009.  The group will also review the results of and protocols in place for various Nephops trawl surveys existing within ICES.

Nephrops spend a great deal of time in their burrows and their emergence behaviour is influenced many factors; time of year, light intensity and tidal strength.  Underwater television surveys to monitor the abundance of Nephrops populations was pioneered in Scotland in early 1990s.  Since then, regular surveys have been conducted for many of the main Nephrops fisheries around Britain and Ireland.  The technique has also been used in Danish, Greek, Italian and Spanish waters.  Since 2009, ICES has been using Nephrops UWTV surveys as the main basis for assessment and to generate catch options for many of the stocks in ICES areas IV, VI and VII.

WGNEPS will work to consolidate the results of previous groups into a Cooperative Research Report which outlines the survey methodology and assessment approach used.  WGNEPS will document best practice in terms of procedure and quality control in the form of an UWTV survey manual for the Series of ICES Survey Protocols (SISP).  The group will review new surveys or any changes to existing surveys to ensure that they are fit for purpose.
